@{
    Layout = "_Layout";
}

@*When we do not explicitly specify the layout i do receive the _layout view that this application has.How
    does this happen it has happend because of bit of magical file that exists here inside of pages folder 
    and this is the magical file._ViewStart.CSHTML.
    when asp.net core goes to render a view or a page it also going to look for an_Viewstate file and then
    it is also going to execute the code inside of the _viewstate. If i want a default view for every page in the app
    i can place the layout in viewstart *@
